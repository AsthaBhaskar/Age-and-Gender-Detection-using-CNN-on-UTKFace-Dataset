# Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-CNN-on-UTKFace-Dataset

## Problem Statement
The problem statement is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately detect the age and gender of individuals in images from the UTKFace dataset. The UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset consisting of over 20,000 images of faces with varying ages and genders, captured under different lighting conditions and facial expressions. The dataset includes individuals of different ethnicities, making it a challenging dataset for age and gender detection.

The objective is to design a CNN architecture that can learn meaningful features from the images and classify them into the correct age and gender categories with high accuracy. The proposed model should be able to handle variations in facial expressions, lighting conditions, and other factors that can affect the performance of the model. Additionally, the model should be able to deal with the imbalance in the distribution of age and gender classes in the dataset.

## Dataset
The UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset consisting of over 20,000 images of faces with varying ages, genders, and ethnicities. The dataset was collected from the internet and contains images of individuals from different countries, races, and ethnicities. The UTKFace dataset is often used as a benchmark dataset for age and gender classification tasks.

Each image in the UTKFace dataset is labeled with the individual's age, gender, and ethnicity. The age labels range from 0 to 116 years old, and the gender labels are binary (male/female). The ethnicity labels include five categories: White, Black, Asian, Indian, and Others.
